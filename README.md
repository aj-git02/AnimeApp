# AnimeApp

A simple app made using flutter to search manga and anime using API calls

The app uses Jikan API to get info from MyAnimeList.net, dependencies include http: ^0.12.2 to deal with API calls

How to run the code: you need to download an andoid emulator or connect an android phone with usb debugging enabled, you also need Android studio and flutter (read https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows for detailed instructions). After this you need to copy all the files from the repository in a folder and run 'flutter pub get' to get all dependencies. Then you can run the code in whichever code editor you want to.

Features of the App: Using the app you can search anime, manga and anime characters from the web and details about results from your query will be displayed on the app, there is a search bar with recent searches functionality and also sugestions to search in manga, anime and characters. After you enter your serach you'll be givven a list of results which you can click for more information. We plan to add more types of queries in the future as well as other APIs from websites like AnimeNewsNetwork and aniList. We tried to add these two but faced problems and had to scrap half of our code, hopefully the problems will be resolved in the future.

Use-case of the App: From personal experience, there are too many anime websites to browse and store anime and manga, and keeping track of your accounts on each one can be frusterating, so the app provides a platform to search and get results from multiple sites at once.
